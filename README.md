Summary

This class introduces core concepts of data science development with a focus on Python programming tools. Students will learn and exercise key skills used by professional data-science practitioners including data engineers, analysts, and machine learning engineers.
  
### Required Materials
This course will make use of the following textbooks as well as relevant online resources:
- Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython, 2nd edition. Wes McKinney
- Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas, Stefanie Molin
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition. Aurélien Géron

These books should be accessible free of charge through OReilly Books online, but can also be purchased as hard copy if desired.

Students will need the following development resources:
- A https://colab.research.google.com/ account
- A https://github.com account
- A https://datacamp.com  account

Students choosing to use their own personal computer will need to install Python 3.6+ as well as the Jupyter notebook application.  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ is a good option for this.

### Class Structure & Topics

Each week students will have assigned reading, tutorials or video lectures, as well as in-class lecture and exercises covering the following topics. Sequence and precise list is subject to revision:
- Intro to Data Science
- Python for data science
- Data handling with NumPy & Pandas
- Data visualization
- Exploratory statistics
- Time series and categorical data analysis
- Probability & hypothesis testing
- Prediction and classification
- Introductory Machine Learning
- Data Science ethics

### Grading

Grades will be based on regular assignments (85%) and 3 quizzes (15%).

Homework assignments will be posted on Canvas each Monday and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week.
Assignments are due by the following Sunday and late assignments may be automatically marked down by 10%.

Students should publish completed programming assignments to their github.com repository and submit the repository link in Canvas. Successful submissions can downloadable from that repository, and should execute in Google Colab without errors.

You may discuss how to approach a problem with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.
